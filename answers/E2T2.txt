Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

- S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled.
- Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest
- VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
- Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
