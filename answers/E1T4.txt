Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access 
the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security. 
List these 2 practices, and a justification for your choices, in the text file named E1T4.txt.


#1
The assumed role for the web service grants all s3 actions,
this is poor a choice because all s3 buckets on the account can be accessed and all files can be replaced
which makes it susceptible to ransomeware.

#2 There was no type of encryption on the secret recipe bucket, the secret recipe content can be read
by anyone with any type of access to the account.

#3
The security group on the web service instance (WebAppSG) allows ingress traffic
from the internet to the web service instance on
ports 22, 80 and 5000 and allow all egress traffic from the server,
even though the server is behind a load balancer. This still exposes the instance to any form of attack
from the internet.
