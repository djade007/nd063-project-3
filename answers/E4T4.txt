# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Moving the web application instance to the private subnet with a NAT Gateway can reduce the internet facing attack.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Creating a VPC private endpoints could help but it doesn't deny all access from outside the endpoint.
    If a user from the same account is authenticated, this policy still allows the user to access the bucket from outside the VPC endpoint.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No. Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket.
    After you enable default encryption, the encryption that you set applies only to future uploads.
    To change the encryption of an existing object to SSE-KMS, you must re-upload the object. Or, you can copy the object over itself.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The configurations would be reset to the initial cloudformation values.
